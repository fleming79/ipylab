    "# Ipylab\n",
    "\n",
    "`Ipylab` is the primary class that provides functionality for scheduling and awaiting operations between Python objects and the corresponding model in the frontend. Each operation is run as a Task which is assigned a UUID and sent as a custom message. \n",
    "\n",
    "`IpylabModel` has a `base` object that is set prior to being *ready*. The base object is specified by the Python class and located by the frontend model with the `ipylabInit` method (customised by other subclasses). \n",
    "\n",
    "## Operations\n",
    "\n",
    "The `operation` method is the workhorse through which all asynchronous messaging is done. It will always return a task. Each operation much be implement in the frontend model. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Generic methods\n",
    "\n",
    " `Ipylab` implements the following generic methods interact with objects in the fronted: \n",
    "\n",
    "* execute_method\n",
    "* get_property\n",
    "* set_property\n",
    "* update_property\n",
    "* list_properties\n",
    "\n",
    "These methods pass an object to utility functions reducing the need to write corresponding code in the frontend. \n",
    "\n",
    "By default the methods the `base`. A different base object can be specified `obj=Obj.###` to specify a different path.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Signals\n",
    "\n",
    "* list_signals\n",
    "* list_view_signals\n",
    "* register_signal_callback\n",
    "\n",
    "These methods provide for identification of signals and registering callbacks to those signals in the frontend.\n"

    "## Connection\n",
    "\n",
    "A `Connection` is subclassed from `Ipylab` providing a connection to an object in the frontend. \n",
    "\n",
    "Each connection has a unique `connection_id`.  The `connection_id` consists of the class prefix `ipylab-<CLASS NAME>|` followed by one or more parts joined with a pipe. The class prefix part of the `connection_id` determines the type of class that is created when creating a new instance.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the kernel there is only one instance of a Connection object per `connection_id`. For example: calling `Connection('ipylab-Connection|my connection_id')` multiple times will get the same object inside the same kernel.\n",
    "\n",
    "The object in the frontend is stored as an ObservableDisposable and once it has be set, it cannot be replaced with another object, unless it has been disposed.\n",
    "\n",
    "Calling the close method in Python will by default dispose of the object in the frontend. This can behavior can be changed by using `dispose=False`, or previously setting the 'auto_dispose` trait to False.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Subclasses\n",
    "\n",
    "Subclasses of `Connection` are identified by its *prefix*. Connection subclasses provide specific functionality relevant to the object. Generally, connections are stored in the `connection` attributed of the class in which they were created.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Connection models\n",
    "\n",
    "Currently there are two Javascript classes models for connections, `ConnectionModel` and `ShellConnectionModel`. `ShellConnectionModel` is specific for widgets that are loaded in the shell.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Making a connection\n",
    "\n",
    "Normally a connection is not instantated directly. To obtain a connection specify the `transform` as a `Transform.connection`.\n",
